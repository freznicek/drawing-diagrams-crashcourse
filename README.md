# IT Drawing diagrams crashcourse

Let's try to summarize basic IT drawing rules to make your drawings better.

## 1. Motto

> A picture is worth a thousand words

is an English language-idiom. It refers to the notion that a complex idea can be conveyed with just a single picture much more effectively than a description does.

## 2. Drawing guidelines

### Why to draw?

 * A picture is worth a thousand words
 * Quicker understanding of a problem (by the audience)
 * Language neutral form

### What to draw?

 * Understand what you want to show to the drawing audience

### Who to draw for?

 * Understand who is the audience
   * balance the idea vs details

### How to draw?
 * Diagram types
   * [Understand the basic diagram types](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/General_diagram_types)
   * [Mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) or more generally [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map)
 * Use basic geometric objects for both drawing composition and drawing elements
   * lines
   * rectangles
   * circles
   * triangles
   * ellipses
 * Keep in mind to use certain maximal objects in the drawing (let say 20)
   * if you're about to break the rule change the diagram type or do not repeat all the element by using `...`
 
### Others

 * Take your time, don't hurry
 * Use colors
 * Keep the simplest geometrical grid
   * square / rectagular
   * circular
 * Don't repeat every detail more than once / twice
 * Always first draw on paper before making an electronic one

## 3. Drawing diagrams electronically
